/* Revenue by Film (Future-proof: Category & Rating included)
   Grain: one row per film (never duplicated by category).
   Why: film â†” category can be many-to-many in other datasets. We compute revenue per film first,
        then attach exactly one deterministic category so totals are stable even if a film has multiple categories.
   Category choice: MAX(c.name) picks one category alphabetically (stable, deterministic).
   Join path (revenue): payment -> rental -> inventory -> film
   Metric: SUM(p.amount) as revenue
