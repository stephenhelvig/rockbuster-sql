/* Customer LTV by Country (Active View, PostgreSQL)

Purpose:
  One row per customer with their lifetime rentals and revenue, plus country for mapping.
  Designed as a base table that Tableau can aggregate by country or rank customers.

Grain:
  1 row per customer (scoped to their current addressâ€™ country).

Strategy:
  - Join spine: payment -> rental -> customer -> address -> city -> country.
    (INNER JOINs restrict to customers who generated revenue.)
  - Aggregate at customer_id, then let BI tools roll up by country as needed.

Outputs:
  customer_id,
  country,
  rentals        (COUNT of rental_id),
  total_amount   (SUM of payment.amount)

Guards:
  - None needed for this dataset; starting at payment excludes zero-activity customers.
    If you need to include customers with zero payments, switch the last two joins to LEFT JOINs
    from customer and wrap SUM with COALESCE(...,0).

Notes:
  Sorting by total_amount DESC then rentals makes Top-N selection straightforward in BI.
