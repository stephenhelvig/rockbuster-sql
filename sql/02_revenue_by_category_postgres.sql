/* Revenue by Category â€” Catalog View (PostgreSQL)

Purpose: Summarize rentals & revenue by category while keeping the denominator = ALL films
         in each category (catalog-based), not just films that generated revenue.

Grain:   1 row per category (category_id).

Strategy:
  - films CTE: counts distinct films per category from the catalog.
  - rev CTE:   rolls up rentals & revenue via payment -> rental -> inventory -> film.
  - LEFT JOIN on category_id preserves categories with zero rentals/revenue.
  - Per-film metrics divide by films_in_category (catalog denominator).

Outputs:
  category, films_in_category, rentals, revenue, rentals_per_film, revenue_per_film.

Guards:
  COALESCE(...) to treat missing activity as 0; NULLIF(...) to avoid divide-by-zero.
