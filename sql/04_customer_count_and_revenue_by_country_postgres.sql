/* Customer Count & Revenue by Country (Catalog View, PostgreSQL)

Purpose:
  Country-level rollup showing how many customers per country and how much theyâ€™ve paid in total.

Grain:
  1 row per country.

Strategy:
  - Join spine: customer -> address -> city -> country.
  - Aggregate at country.

Outputs:
  country,
  customer_count  (COUNT DISTINCT customer_id),
  total_payment   (SUM payment.amount, 0 if no payments)

Guards:
  - COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) to show 0 instead of NULL when no payments.
