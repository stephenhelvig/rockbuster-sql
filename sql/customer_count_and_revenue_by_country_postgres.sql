/* Customer Count & Revenue by Country (Catalog View, PostgreSQL)

Purpose:
  Country-level rollup showing how many customers you have and how much theyâ€™ve paid in total.
  Counts all customers by country; countries with zero payments are still included.

Grain:
  1 row per country.

Strategy:
  - Join spine (customers -> geography): customer -> address -> city -> country.
  - LEFT JOIN to rental -> payment so countries with customers but no payments remain.
  - Aggregate at country.

Outputs:
  country,
  customer_count  (COUNT DISTINCT customer_id),
  total_payment   (SUM payment.amount, 0 if no payments)

Guards:
  - COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) to show 0 instead of NULL when no payments.
  - Using LEFT JOINs preserves countries with zero activity.

Notes:
  If you only want countries with actual payments, switch the two LEFT JOINs to INNER JOINs
  and remove COALESCE.
